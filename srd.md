# Sigma Runtime Documentation (SRD)

This section provides a human-readable description of the Sigma Runtime Standard
and its underlying cognitive architecture.

Unlike the SRS (canonical SRIP specifications), this documentation focuses on:

- conceptual explanations,
- system-level diagrams,
- practical interpretations,
- educational examples,
- high-level architecture breakdowns.

Use this documentation as a companion guide to the formal SRIP documents located
in the **/SRS** section.
