# Sigma Runtime Documentation (SRD)

The **Sigma Runtime Documentation (SRD)** provides the human-readable foundation of the  
**Sigma Runtime Standard (SRS)** — a coherent framework describing attractor-based cognition,  
recursive coherence mechanisms, and runtime safety architectures within LLM-mediated cognitive systems.

---

## Purpose

SRD serves as the **interpretive and educational layer** of the Sigma Runtime Standard.  
While SRS defines canonical mechanisms and technical invariants, SRD focuses on:

- conceptual explanations and annotated overviews,  
- system-level diagrams and interaction models,  
- practical guidance for implementers,  
- and interpretive notes for research and governance teams.

It bridges the gap between **formal specification (SRS)** and **operational practice (Runtime implementation)**.

---

## Structure

The SRD set includes several key sections:

| Section | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Overview** | Conceptual introduction to Sigma Runtime and its role within Sigma Stratum. |
| **Architecture** | Describes the layered runtime design (SL0–SL6) and cognitive field integration. |
| **Runtime Loop** | Defines the recursive control cycle (RCL), drift management, and coherence maintenance. |
| **Memory** | Outlines persistent, semantic, and symbolic memory systems. |
| **Attractors** | Explains attractor formation, classification, and transition protocols. |
| **Metrics** | Provides quantitative indices (Drift, Density, Coherence). |
| **Failsafe** | Documents the Fail-Safe Envelope and AEGIDA integration. |

Each section corresponds to a dedicated document within the `/srd/` directory and follows  
the standard header template from [`/templates/LICENSE-HEADER.md`](https://github.com/sigmastratum/documentation/blob/main/templates/LICENSE-HEADER.md).

---

## Relation to SRS and SSRG

The **SRS** defines the normative runtime architecture, safety principles, and canonical terminology.  
The **SRD** documents interpret these specifications for developers, researchers, and governance bodies.  
The **SSRG (Sigma Stratum Research Group)** maintains both the SRD and SRS,  
oversees SRIP proposals, and ensures consistency across the Sigma ecosystem.

---

## Governance and Updates

SRD documents are maintained through the **Sigma Runtime Improvement Proposal (SRIP)** process.  
Each revision is peer-reviewed by SSRG maintainers and merged after validation against the canonical SRS.  
See [`/team/srip-process.md`](https://github.com/sigmastratum/documentation/blob/main/team/srip-process.md)  
for workflow details and review policies.
