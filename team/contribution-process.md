# Contribution Process

Contributions to the Sigma Stratum Documentation and Sigma Runtime Standard  
are managed through a transparent, review-based process under the  
**Sigma Stratum Research Group (SSRG)**.

---

## 1. Types of Contributions

### **Descriptive / Conceptual (SRD)**
Improvements to explanatory, architectural, or theoretical documentation.  
These changes expand or clarify the Sigma Runtime model and do not alter normative standards.

### **Normative / Technical (SRS / SRIP)**
Changes that modify, extend, or define the Sigma Runtime Standard.  
These contributions are submitted as formal **Sigma Runtime Improvement Proposals (SRIPs)**.

## 2. How to Contribute

1. Review existing documentation and open SRIPs in this repository.  
2. Discuss your idea in the **Issues** or **Discussions** section.  
3. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your proposal.  
4. Submit a **pull request** containing your changes or a new SRIP draft.  
5. The **SSRG Steering Committee** reviews and assigns your contribution:  
   - *SRD contributions* are merged after editorial review.  
   - *SRIP proposals* follow the [SRIP Process](/team/srip-process.md).  
6. Once approved, the change is merged and versioned in the next SRS or SRD release.
