# SRIP Process

The SRIP process defines how the Sigma Runtime Standard evolves.

### Lifecycle Stages

1. **Draft**  
   Initial specification written by contributor(s).

2. **Review**  
   Technical evaluation by the Research Group and designated reviewers.

3. **Revision**  
   Updates based on review feedback.

4. **Approval**  
   Steering Committee votes to accept, defer, or reject.

5. **Integration**  
   Editors merge the SRIP into the canonical SRS repository.

6. **Release**  
   Included in the next version of the Sigma Runtime Standard.

This process ensures transparency, traceability, and long-term coherence.
