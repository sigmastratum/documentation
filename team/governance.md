# Governance Model

The Sigma Stratum initiative follows a transparent, open-standard governance
process modeled after IETF, W3C, and OpenAPI working groups.

Core components:

**Steering Committee (SC)**  
Responsible for approving SRIPs, overseeing standard evolution, and ensuring
alignment with architectural principles.

**Editors**  
Maintain the canonical SRS repository and ensure consistency across SRIPs.

**Contributors**  
Researchers and developers who submit proposals, analyses, improvements, or
corrective changes.

**Reviewers**  
Provide technical reviews on SRIPs and research materials.

Governance is meritocratic and based on demonstrated contribution and expertise.
