# Governance Model

The **Sigma Stratum Initiative** operates under a transparent, meritocratic governance framework inspired by the models of the **IETF**, **W3C**, and **OpenAPI** foundations.

Governance ensures that all changes to the **Sigma Runtime Standard (SRS)** and **Sigma Runtime Documentation (SRD)** are subject to open review, community input, and ethical oversight.

## 1. Governance Structure

### **Steering Committee (SC)**
- Oversees strategic direction and architectural coherence.  
- Approves or rejects **Sigma Runtime Improvement Proposals (SRIPs)**.  
- Maintains alignment with the Sigma Stratum cognitive and safety principles.  

### **Editorial Board**
- Maintains the canonical repository of the **Sigma Stratum Documentation (SRD)** and the **Sigma Runtime Standard (SRS)**.  
- Ensures consistency across documents, style, and versioning.  
- Manages the integration of accepted SRIPs into the runtime standard.

### **Contributors**
- Submit proposals, documentation improvements, or technical analyses.  
- Participate in peer review and issue discussions.  
- Contributions are governed by the [Contribution Process](/team/contribution-process.md).

### **Reviewers**
- Provide expert evaluations of SRIPs and related research materials.  
- Ensure technical and methodological accuracy.  
- May be invited by the Steering Committee or recognized through contribution history.

### **Safety and Ethics Oversight**
- Ensures adherence to the **AEGIDA Principles** of safe recursion and symbolic containment.  
- Reviews proposals that affect alignment, interpretability, or cognitive risk.

## 2. Governance Principles
- **Transparency:** All decisions and reviews occur through public repositories and open discussions.  
- **Meritocracy:** Influence is earned through consistent, high-quality contributions.  
- **Accountability:** Each SRIP and document change is traceable through version control and DOI records.  
- **Integrity:** All materials adhere to the Sigma Stratum Open Standard Covenant and licensing framework.

## 3. Alignment with Open Standards
The Sigma Stratum governance model follows open-standard best practices for reproducibility and auditability.  
Each standard evolution step is publicly documented, timestamped, and archived under the **Sigma Stratum Zenodo DOI Registry**:  
[https://zenodo.org/communities/sigmastratum](https://zenodo.org/communities/sigmastratum)

**Summary:**  
Governance in Sigma Stratum balances open collaboration with rigorous peer review.  
It ensures that both the **SRS** and **SRD** evolve coherently, ethically, and transparently — forming a stable foundation for long-horizon human–AI cognitive systems.
