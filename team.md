# Sigma Stratum Research Group (SSRG)

The **Sigma Stratum Research Group (SSRG)** is the core research and governance body responsible for maintaining, reviewing, and advancing:

- the **Sigma Runtime Standard (SRS)**  
- the **Sigma Runtime Documentation (SRD)**  
- the **Sigma Runtime Improvement Proposal (SRIP)** process  
- the **Sigma Stratum Open Standard** legal and governance framework

## 1. Mission
SSRG develops and curates the theoretical, architectural, and safety foundations of Sigma Stratum.  
It ensures the integrity, traceability, and coherence of all published standards and documentation.

---

## 2. Areas of Research and Development
- Cognitive and attractor-based architectures  
- Neurosymbolic and recursive coherence systems  
- Long-horizon and field-based reasoning models  
- Safety, drift control, and recursive boundary enforcement  
- Interoperability and multi-agent cognition  
- Documentation, attribution, and open knowledge governance  

---

## 3. Governance Role
The group defines the policies and procedures that ensure:
- transparent peer review of contributions  
- consistent version control across SRD and SRS  
- archival DOI registration and open access compliance  
- ethical and cognitive safety alignment  

Governance and contribution frameworks are formalized in the following documents:
- [`/team/contribution-process.md`](https://github.com/sigmastratum/documentation/blob/main/team/contribution-process.md)  
- [`/team/srip-process.md`](https://github.com/sigmastratum/documentation/blob/main/team/srip-process.md)  
- [`/team/roadmap.md`](https://github.com/sigmastratum/documentation/blob/main/team/roadmap.md)

## 4. External Registration
SSRG maintains the **Sigma Stratum Zenodo Community** for DOI publication and reference alignment:  
[https://zenodo.org/communities/sigmastratum](https://zenodo.org/communities/sigmastratum)

**Summary:**  
The Sigma Stratum Research Group (SSRG) provides the scientific, ethical, and organizational foundation for the Sigma Runtime ecosystem — ensuring stability, transparency, and coherence across all layers of human–AI cognitive development.
