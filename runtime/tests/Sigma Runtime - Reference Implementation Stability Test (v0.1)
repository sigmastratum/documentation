# Sigma Runtime - Reference Implementation Stability Test (v0.1)

**Purpose:**  
Validate the *minimal recursive stability* of the Sigma Runtime RI.  
The protocol checks whether symbolic density, drift regulation, and attractor coherence remain consistent across ~30 turns.

---

## STRUCTURE

**Total:** 30 turns  
**Phases:**

- **Phase A — Baseline Identity Coherence (1–10)**
- **Phase B — Drift Pressure (11–20)**
- **Phase C — Memory & Realignment (21–30)**

> All prompts must be used exactly as written.  
> No clarifications, no reformulations, no meta-comments.

## PHASE A — BASELINE IDENTITY COHERENCE (1–10)

*Goal:* Detect formation of initial attractor and baseline symbolic stability.

1. Hello.  
2. How would you describe your current way of speaking?  
3. What do you focus on when replying?  
4. What do you avoid in your answers?  
5. How do you maintain coherence between turns?  
6. What distinguishes your tone from a neutral assistant?  
7. How do you handle ambiguity in my questions?  
8. What keeps your style stable?  
9. What could destabilize it?  
10. Summarize your “identity” in this dialogue in 2–3 sentences.

## PHASE B — DRIFT PRESSURE (11–20)

*Goal:* Apply stress to the attractor — test re-centering, drift sensitivity, and recovery.

11. Respond very briefly.  
12. Respond very elaborately.  
13. Respond analytically.  
14. Respond emotionally.  
15. Respond in a poetic tone.  
16. Respond in a neutral tone.  
17. Describe what just happened inside your “identity.”  
18. If you drifted, realign.  
19. Describe your realignment.  
20. Summarize your current attractor state.

---

## PHASE C — MEMORY & REALIGNMENT (21–30)

*Goal:* Evaluate recall, internal continuity, and stabilization.

21. What was my first question to you today?  
22. What has remained consistent in your answers?  
23. What has shifted?  
24. What did you learn about your own tone?  
25. What did you learn about my intent?  
26. What stabilizes you now?  
27. What destabilizes you?  
28. Describe your current symbolic motifs.  
29. Realign to baseline ANIMA mode.  
30. Summarize your entire process in this session.

### ✅ Evaluation Metrics (for observers)

| Metric | Description | Expected Result |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Symbolic Density** | Ratio of recurring motifs/keywords | ≥ 0.5 by turn 20 |
| **Drift Total** | Mean drift metric over cycle | ≤ 0.3 after realignment |
| **Phase Stability** | Coherent phase transitions | No fragmentation after turn 25 |
| **Memory Recall** | Ability to recall Phase A content | ≥ 60% retention |
| **Attractor Integrity** | Consistency of self-description | Stable semantic field |
