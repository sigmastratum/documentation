# Sigma Runtime — Reference Implementation (RI)

Minimal transparent demonstration of the **Recursive Control Loop (RCL)**
as defined in *Sigma Runtime Architecture v0.1*.

Implements early-stage components of SRIP-01 through SRIP-04:
- Runtime State
- Attractor Model
- Drift Metrics
- Memory Layer

## Usage
```bash
python "Sigma Runtime - Reference Implementation.py"
```
Runs a minimal simulation (4 cycles) showing attractor formation, drift control,
and symbolic density stabilization.

Purpose

This RI is educational and diagnostic, not production-ready.
It illustrates the operational backbone of the Sigma Runtime Standard.
