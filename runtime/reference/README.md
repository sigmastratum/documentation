# Sigma Runtime — Reference Implementation (RI)

Minimal transparent demonstration of the **Recursive Control Loop (RCL)**  
as defined in *Sigma Runtime Architecture v0.1*.

Implements early-stage components of **SRIP-01** through **SRIP-04**:
- Runtime State  
- Attractor Model  
- Drift Metrics  
- Memory Layer  

---

## Usage

[→ Sigma Runtime - Reference Implementation.py](./Sigma%20Runtime%20-%20Reference%20Implementation.py)

Runs a minimal simulation (4 cycles) showing attractor formation, drift control,  
and symbolic density stabilization.

---

## Purpose

This RI is **educational and diagnostic**, not production-ready.  
It illustrates the operational backbone of the **Sigma Runtime Standard** —  
demonstrating attractor stabilization, recursive coherence, and drift regulation  
within a self-contained runtime environment.
