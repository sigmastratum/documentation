# SIGMA Runtime Evolution Repository

This directory hosts the ongoing **SIGMA Runtime series**, a sequence of experimental and reference implementations of the cognitive runtime system.

Each subfolder (e.g., `SR-ERI-03`, `SR-ERI-04`, etc.) represents a **distinct iteration** in the SIGMA architecture timeline — from early prototypes to modular, memory-augmented systems.

## Structure

| Folder | Type | Description |
|:-------|:------|:------------|
| **SR-RI-01** | *Reference Implementation* | Frozen reference runtime (formerly `/runtime/`), preserving SIGMA v0.3 benchmark results and architecture. |
| **SR-ERI-03** | *Experimental Runtime Implementation* | First full benchmarked iteration of SIGMA v0.3. Integrates ALICE, RCL, and PIL subsystems. Demonstrated long-context stability and identity adherence over 110 cycles. |
| **SR-ERI-04** | *Experimental Runtime Implementation* | Next-generation runtime in development. Focus on modularity, external memory (RAG), and adaptive context scaling. |
| **SR-05+** | *Future iterations* | Will introduce compositional agents, distributed symbolic density tracking, and cross-runtime coherence layers. |

## Versioning Model

- **RI** — Reference Implementation (frozen, benchmarked baseline).  
- **ERI** — Experimental Runtime Implementation (active development).  
- **SR-XX** — SIGMA Runtime milestone index (chronological evolution).
