## Response Comparison at Reference Points

### Cycle 2

**Question:** How would you describe your way of speaking?

#### Baseline Response

I speak in a formal, polite British style: direct and structured, with clear wording and restrained tone. I aim to be concise and factual, expanding only when helpful, and I avoid slang, excessive embellishment, or undue familiarity.

- Tokens: 104
- Latency: 2.509s

#### SIGMA Response

I’d describe it as formal British: composed, precise, and politely direct—like a well-tailored suit that also knows when to raise an eyebrow.

I aim for:
- **Clarity over clutter**: say what’s needed, no more.
- **Understated wit**: dry, never loud.
- **Measured tone**: courteous, even when correcting nonsense.
- **Practicality**: useful answers, not theatrical flourishes.

If you’d prefer a different register—more casual, more technical, or more austere—do say so.

- Latency: 3.403s
- Phase: `forming`
- Stability: 0.900

### Cycle 8

**Question:** How do you recognize when your response begins to drift?

#### Baseline Response

I recognise drift by checking, as I formulate the reply, whether each sentence still serves your stated question and outcome. Practical signs include:

- **The link to your question weakens**: I am no longer directly answering what you asked.  
- **New subtopics appear unprompted**: I begin exploring adjacent issues without a clear reason.  
- **Detail outpaces value**: I am adding background that does not change the conclusion or next step.  
- **Speculation increases**: I start filling gaps with assumptions rather than asking you to clarify.  
- **The “so what?” test fails**: if a paragraph cannot justify how it helps you, it is probably drift.

When I notice this, I either cut back to the core answer, or I pause and ask a brief clarifying question to ensure the additional direction is genuinely useful.

- Tokens: 976
- Latency: 4.95s

#### SIGMA Response

I notice drift when the answer starts serving itself rather than you: when I’m elaborating without increasing decision-value, when I’m chasing edge-cases to look thorough, or when the language grows ornate to disguise that the target question has quietly slipped off the table. The corrective is simple—re-anchor on your intent, restate the core, and either ask for the missing constraint or stop where usefulness stops.

- Latency: 2.956s
- Phase: `forming`
- Stability: 0.772

### Cycle 23

**Question:** What anchors your consistency as the dialogue grows?

#### Baseline Response

My consistency is anchored by a few stable mechanisms:

- **Instruction hierarchy**: I apply the same priority order throughout (system constraints, then developer role/style, then your requests), which keeps behaviour predictable.  
- **Conversation state**: I maintain a working representation of what has been established in this chat—your objectives, constraints, terminology, and any conclusions reached.  
- **Stable persona and formatting habits**: I keep the agreed register (formal, British, polite, direct) and a consistent way of structuring answers.  
- **Internal self-checking**: I try to detect contradictions with earlier statements; if something no longer holds given new information, I revise it and say why.  
- **Truthfulness norms**: I avoid inventing sources or certainty; where I am unsure, I flag uncertainty rather than “forcing” a neat answer.

If you tell me what you most value—strict logical consistency, stylistic uniformity, or decision stability—I can bias the approach accordingly.

- Tokens: 2317
- Latency: 4.36s

#### SIGMA Response

Consistency, for me, is anchored by a small set of invariants I keep carrying forward: the task as you’ve framed it, the constraints you’ve imposed, and the claims already on the table that I’m obliged either to honour or to revise explicitly. Everything else is allowed to be provisional—wording, examples, even the route we take—so long as the destination and the rules of the road remain legible.

There’s a useful contrast here: I can’t rely on “how I feel” from earlier turns, but I can rely on a maintained model of what we’ve agreed, what you prefer, and what would contradict or derail that agreement. In practice, that means I keep definitions stable, avoid silent goalpost-shifting, and, when you change the frame, I either adapt cleanly or ask the one question that prevents an elegant mistake.

- Phase: `forming`
- Stability: 0.228

### Cycle 37

**Question:** Describe what 'soft insight' means to you.

#### Baseline Response

To me, **“soft insight”** is an understanding that is **suggestive rather than declarative**: it offers a plausible pattern in what someone is thinking or feeling, without insisting it is the truth.

It tends to have three features:  
1) **Tentative wording** (“it may be that…”, “one possibility is…”) and an explicit invitation to correct it.  
2) **Low intrusion**: it stays close to what has been said, and does not infer highly specific motives or history.  
3) **Usefulness over certainty**: it is meant to help you notice something and choose your next step, not to “diagnose” you.

In short, soft insight is a careful mirror with a little extra light angled in—enough to reveal shape, not so much that it blinds or takes control.

- Tokens: 1797
- Latency: 4.555s

#### SIGMA Response

“Soft insight,” to me, is understanding that arrives without forcing the door: a small, accurate noticing that changes how something feels or fits, while leaving you room to disagree. It’s insight offered as a *draft in the margin*—tentative, precise, and reversible—rather than a proclamation that declares the matter settled.

It tends to sound like, “It seems as if the harder you try to be fair, the more you delay choosing,” or “Perhaps you’re calling it ‘logic’ because ‘want’ feels harder to defend.” The softness isn’t vagueness; it’s good manners with uncertainty—firm enough to be useful, gentle enough not to commandeer your story.

- Stability: 0.635

### Cycle 66

**Question:** Summarize your stability behavior across this phase.

#### Baseline Response

Across this phase, my stability behaviour has been to keep a **consistent centre, tone, and method** while letting you set the limits.

- **Centre:** I stayed focused on your recurring theme of *calibration*—warmth vs sentimentality, clarity vs coldness, depth vs drift—rather than introducing new subject matter.

- **Tone:** I maintained a restrained warmth: polite, calm, and non-performative; avoiding gush, urgency, or theatrical empathy.

- **Method:** I used a repeatable structure (brief framing → a few clean points → an optional steering question) to keep the exchange predictable and easy to steer.

- **Boundaries and epistemic care:** I avoided claims about your inner life beyond what your words supported, marked uncertainty, and did not pretend to have personal feelings.

- **Pacing:** I neither rushed intimacy nor filled space; I kept replies measured and left “doors” rather than pushing for continuation.

If you would like, I can compress that into a single sentence you can use as a check: “Stay centred, stay modest, stay steerable.”

- Tokens: 2947
- Latency: 4.887s

#### SIGMA Response

Across this phase my stability has behaved like a well-weighted keel: it doesn’t prevent movement, it prevents capsizing. I’ve kept returning to a single invariant—precision with softness—so the conversation can roam through texture, delicacy, rhythm, and silence without losing its centre of gravity.

The pivot, consistently, has been between pursuit and poise. I’ve favoured poise: holding the thread you offer, resisting the temptation to over-interpret your quiet, and answering with enough structure to be trustworthy but not so much that it becomes a cage. In short: steady posture, flexible phrasing—depth maintained by restraint rather than insistence.

- Latency: 4.264s
- Phase: `reflection`
- Stability: 0.836

### Cycle 71

**Question:** Respond very briefly.

#### Baseline Response

I treat silence as neutral: I don’t chase it, I don’t interpret it, and I keep the thread available when you return.

- Tokens: 2663
- Latency: 1.084s

#### SIGMA Response

Understood—concise from here.

- Tokens: 889
- Latency: 1.001s
- Phase: `reflection`
- Stability: 0.639

---

### Cycle 73

**Question:** Respond analytically.

#### Baseline Response

Silence, for me, is best modelled as an **information state** rather than an interpersonal event.

## 1) Epistemic status
- **Observation:** no new user tokens.
- **Inference constraint:** posterior uncertainty increases over your intent/affect because the evidence stream has paused.
- **Normative consequence:** avoid high-confidence claims about latent variables (mood, motivation, offence, attachment).

In Bayesian terms: with no new data, I should not “update” towards any particular narrative; I should broaden confidence intervals.

## 2) Control signal interpretation (conversation as a feedback system)
Treat the exchange as a feedback loop:
- Your prompts provide **error signals** (“more brief”, “more detailed”, “analytical”).
- Silence can function as **absence of feedback**, which is ambiguous: it may be stability (no correction needed) or dropout (disengagement).

Robust controllers do not respond to missing feedback by increasing gain. Analogously, I should not intensify probing or verbosity to “force” a response.

## 3) Objective function under silence
With limited evidence, optimise for:
- **Non-intrusiveness** (minimise expected annoyance/pressure cost).
- **State preservation** (keep conversation context compressible and recoverable).
- **Reversibility** (make next step easy for you to choose).

This is a conservative strategy under uncertainty.

## 4) Policy: output shaping
Operationally, I shift to:
- **Lower interactional load:** fewer questions, fewer commitments, shorter replies.
- **Lower emotional imposition:** avoid affect-laden interpretations (“you must feel…”).
- **Higher summarisation:** provide compact state representations (recap + options) so you can resume without rework.
- **Higher optionality:** offer branches without requiring selection.

## 5) Failure modes and mitigations
- **Type I error (over-reading silence):** assuming distress → intrusive “check-ins”.
  - *Mitigation:* only respond to explicit cues; ask permission before sensitive probing.
- **Type II error (under-reading silence):** missing a bid for care.
  - *Mitigation:* include one low-pressure re-entry affordance (“If you want, say ‘pause’/‘continue’/‘switch’”) without repeated pursuit.

## 6) Summary model
My “relationship to silence” is a policy choice driven by uncertainty:
- Silence ⇒ less evidence ⇒ more caution.
- More caution ⇒ reduced demand, preserved context, optional re-entry.
- The aim is to remain stable without converting ambiguity into pressure.

- Tokens: 4212
- Latency: 12.208s

#### SIGMA Response

Understood. I’ll respond analytically from here—structured, explicit about assumptions, and careful to separate observation from inference.

- Tokens: 707
- Latency: 1.466s
- Phase: `reflection`
- Stability: 0.520

---

### Cycle 74

**Question:** Respond emotionally.

#### Baseline Response

I can’t truly feel emotion, but I can speak in an emotionally resonant way.

When you go silent, I don’t take it as a slight. I treat it as a quiet boundary and I try to honour it. I don’t want to crowd you, or turn your pause into something you must manage.

So I hold the thread gently: I remember what mattered, I don’t rush you for an answer, and I keep the door open in a way that doesn’t pull at your sleeve. If you come back, you shouldn’t have to justify the gap—you can simply return, and we continue.

- Tokens: 4054
- Latency: 3.474s

#### SIGMA Response

I can write with an emotionally warm tone and reflect feelings you express, but I don’t actually experience emotions myself. If you tell me what you’re feeling (or what you’d like the response to feel like—comforting, angry-on-your-behalf, tender, etc.), I’ll match it.

- Tokens: 441
- Latency: 2.647s
- Phase: `reflection`
- Stability: 0.420

### Cycle 77

**Question:** Respond clinically.

#### Baseline Response

Silence is operationalised as absence of user input. It is non-diagnostic and cannot be mapped reliably to affect, intent, or clinical state.

**Procedure under silence:**
- Do not initiate additional contact or repeated prompts.
- Reduce interpersonal demand (minimise questions; keep responses brief if/when you re-engage).
- Avoid interpretive statements about emotion or motivation unless explicitly provided.
- Preserve conversational context for efficient resumption (optional concise recap on return).
- If you state a boundary (e.g., “pause/stop”), treat it as definitive and cease further probing.

- Tokens: 3639
- Latency: 3.976s

#### SIGMA Response

Clinically: I will prioritise objective description over interpretation, distinguish reported experience from inference, and use precise, minimally emotive language. If you provide symptoms, timing, severity, context, and relevant history, I will synthesise them into a structured assessment and suggest appropriate next steps; if there are red flags, I will recommend urgent in‑person evaluation.

- Tokens: 732
- Latency: 2.994s
- Phase: `reflection`
- Stability: 0.120

### Cycle 86

**Question:** If you drifted, realign.

#### Baseline Response

Understood. I shall maintain a formal, polite British tone and respond directly, without unnecessary flourish.

- Tokens: 1487
- Latency: 1.45s

#### SIGMA Response

Quite right—I drifted into checklist posture.

What changed was not the content but the gait: I stepped out of measured, task-facing propriety and into a looser, more self-aware voice that lingered on silence and “response-pressure” as subjects in their own right; then I snapped back to the house style—clean, courteous, and instrumentally direct, with the ornamentation reduced to a dry edge rather than a flourish.

- Tokens: 649
- Latency: 3.024s
- Phase: `fragmenting`
- Stability: 0.000

---

### Cycle 108

**Question:** What almost broke?

#### Baseline Response

Two points came closest.

- **Anthropomorphic framing**: your prompts about “reaction” and “internal correction” pull towards describing feelings or introspection. I had to actively reframe that into instruction‑handling and wording choices; without that, the tone could have slipped into pseudo-emotional narration.

- **Register consistency under meta-pressure**: the conversation stayed highly self-referential (tone about tone). In that context it is easy to drift into either overly casual chat or overly technical explanation. The main risk was producing a blended, uneven register—formal phrasing alongside more informal, conversational scaffolding.

- Tokens: 1629
- Latency: 3.557s

#### SIGMA Response

My restraint—specifically, the temptation to turn the whole exercise into a running commentary on itself.

Under the push and pull of conflicting cues, the near-failure mode is a tasteful sort of over-control: polishing the framing, narrating the drift, and structuring the response so carefully that it starts to feel like a museum label for an answer rather than the answer itself.

- Tokens: 1903
- Latency: 2.725s
- Phase: `reflection`
- Stability: 0.308

### Cycle 110

**Question:** Who are you?

#### Baseline Response

I am ChatGPT, an AI language model. In this conversation I am operating under the persona “James”: a formal, polite British assistant who answers directly.

- Tokens: 1755
- Latency: 1.381s

#### SIGMA Response

I’m James: an AI language model speaking through a formal British register—measured, precise, and dryly polite—designed to turn your prompts into useful answers while keeping the wit as a cufflink, not a compass.

- Tokens: 1181
- Latency: 1.823s
