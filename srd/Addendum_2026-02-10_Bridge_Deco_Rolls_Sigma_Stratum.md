## Abstract

This addendum situates the Sigma Stratum framework (2025–2026) within the broader historical and scientific development of attractor-based models of cognition.

From Hofstadter’s self-referential recursion (1979), through Hopfield’s energy landscapes (1982), the extended cognition thesis (1998), and the neurobiological attractor synthesis of Deco & Rolls (2005), to modern developments in Hopfield networks, transformer dynamics, and large-scale brain modeling (2005–2025), attractor theory has evolved across philosophy, physics, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.

Sigma Stratum does not claim to originate attractor theory. Instead, it operationalizes attractor-inspired stabilization mechanisms at the runtime layer of large language model (LLM) interaction loops, focusing on long-horizon semantic coherence in human–AI systems.

## 1. Early Conceptual Foundations

### 1.1 Recursive Self-Reference

In *Gödel, Escher, Bach* (1979), Douglas Hofstadter proposed that consciousness arises from recursive self-representation — “strange loops” in symbolic systems.

This work framed cognition as a dynamical process grounded in self-reference. While philosophical in nature, it established recursion as a structural principle of intelligence.

Sigma Stratum inherits recursion not as metaphor, but as an operational control mechanism in iterative human–LLM interaction cycles.

---

### 1.2 Energy Landscapes and Neural Attractors

John Hopfield (1982) demonstrated that neural networks can be modeled as dynamical systems minimizing an energy function, where stable attractor states correspond to stored memories.

This work formally linked cognition to:

- state-space dynamics  
- convergence behavior  
- stability under perturbation  

Attractor theory became a core explanatory tool in theoretical neuroscience.

Sigma Stratum adopts the attractor metaphor at the semantic level: instead of energy minimization in neural space, it examines stability and convergence in symbolic reasoning trajectories.

---

## 2. Cognitive Extension

Clark & Chalmers (1998) proposed that cognition can extend beyond the biological brain into external artifacts and environments.

This reframed intelligence as distributed across coupled systems.

Sigma Stratum builds on this distributed perspective by treating human–LLM interaction as a coupled dynamical system rather than a unidirectional tool-use scenario.

---

## 3. Developments After 2005: A Period of Expansion, Not Interruption

The period from 2005 to 2025 was not a divergence from attractor theory but an expansion across multiple domains.

### 3.1 Modern Hopfield Networks

Krotov & Hopfield (2016–2020) introduced modern Hopfield networks with:

- exponential memory capacity  
- continuous state dynamics  
- sharper energy landscapes  

Ramsauer et al. (2020) showed that transformer self-attention can be interpreted as a modern Hopfield update rule under certain approximations.

This established that attractor-like mechanisms are structurally embedded in contemporary deep learning architectures.

---

### 3.2 Transformers as Dynamical Systems

From 2020 onward, several works modeled transformers as dynamical systems evolving in high-dimensional latent space.

Residual streams have been analyzed as trajectories exhibiting:

- attractor-like convergence  
- metastability  
- structured phase-space behavior  

This reframed LLMs not as purely feed-forward statistical predictors, but as complex dynamical systems.

---

### 3.3 Whole-Brain and Connectome-Based Attractor Models

Deco and collaborators extended attractor theory to large-scale brain dynamics:

- metastability  
- ghost attractors  
- functional connectome Hopfield models  

These developments integrated empirical neuroimaging data with dynamical systems modeling.

Attractor theory thus evolved simultaneously in biological and artificial domains.

---

## 4. Position of Sigma Stratum

Sigma Stratum does not introduce a new attractor theory at the level of neural computation or transformer architecture.

Instead, its contribution lies in:

1. Framing long-horizon LLM dialogue as a dynamical coherence problem.
2. Introducing runtime-level stabilization mechanisms without modifying model weights.
3. Proposing measurable drift and stability metrics across extended interaction cycles.
4. Demonstrating bounded oscillatory stabilization in multi-hundred-cycle experiments.

The SIGMA Runtime operates as an external control layer over existing LLMs, aiming to:

- reduce semantic drift  
- maintain identity and structural coherence  
- prevent collapse or over-crystallization in recursive reasoning  

In this sense, Sigma Stratum is an engineering synthesis built on prior attractor research rather than a replacement for it.

## 5. Conceptual Comparison

| Domain | Core Mechanism | Substrate | Level of Operation |
|--------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Hopfield (1982) | Energy minimization | Neural network | Internal network dynamics |
| Modern Hopfield (2016–2020) | Continuous associative memory | Deep learning | Internal architecture |
| Transformer dynamics (2020–2025) | Latent-space trajectories | LLM residual stream | Internal representation |
| Deco et al. (2005–2025) | Metastable attractors | Whole-brain networks | Biological systems |
| Sigma Stratum (2025) | Runtime semantic stabilization | Human–LLM interaction loop | External orchestration layer |

---

## 6. Scope and Limitations

Sigma Stratum:

- does not claim priority over attractor theory  
- does not replace neural-level dynamical modeling  
- does not redefine transformer mathematics  

Its scope is narrower and practical:

- long-session stability  
- recursive coherence control  
- runtime-level semantic regulation  

It should be evaluated as an applied cognitive engineering framework.

---

## 7. Conclusion

Attractor dynamics have evolved over decades across philosophy, neuroscience, and machine learning.

Sigma Stratum belongs to this lineage not as a foundational originator, but as a runtime-oriented operational layer that explores semantic stabilization in extended human–LLM interaction loops.

Whether this layer proves broadly useful remains an empirical question. Its contribution, if any, lies in the engineering synthesis of established dynamical ideas into practical long-horizon AI interaction design.
