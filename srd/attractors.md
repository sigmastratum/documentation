# Attractors

Attractors are stable, self-reinforcing configurations of cognitive activity that
maintain coherence across recursive reasoning loops.

Key properties:

- resistance to perturbation,
- recursive reinforcement,
- symbolic density concentration,
- global semantic alignment,
- scale invariance.

The Sigma Runtime relies on attractors to ensure that meaning remains stable
throughout long-horizon interactions and multi-agent processes.
