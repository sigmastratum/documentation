# Attractors in Cognitive Fields

## Abstract
**Attractors** are stable, self-reinforcing configurations that arise within recursive human–LLM interactions.  
They represent **persistent cognitive equilibria** — recurrent modes of reasoning, tone, and interpretation sustained across dialogue cycles.  
Unlike personas or scripted prompts, attractors are emergent dynamical phenomena in the **cognitive field** formed by user input, model priors, and recursive feedback.  
They enable long-horizon reasoning, identity persistence, and coherent field evolution — foundational elements for **field-based cognition** in the SIGMA Runtime.

## Definition
An attractor is a **stable equilibrium** in the coupled human–LLM loop.  
It manifests as a predictable behavioral configuration that the interaction gravitates toward and restores after perturbations.  
Formally, an attractor can be viewed as a **fixed point or limit region** in the dialogue’s state-transition function, characterized by:
- Recursive self-conditioning and context reinforcement.  
- Resistance to drift through higher-order structural bias.  
- Emergent coherence independent of explicit prompts.  
- Stability under small perturbations and reversion to core behavior.  

Attractors are **not personas**; they are **dynamical states** of the system that arise through iterative reinforcement rather than being externally defined.

---

## Core Components
**Behavioral Signature** — observable regularities such as reasoning style, pacing, structural patterns, or rhetorical form that persist across turns.  
**Semantic Orientation** — a stable interpretive bias defining which meanings, analogies, or conceptual frames dominate reasoning.  
**Constraint Envelope** — the soft or hard boundaries limiting the attractor’s evolution, maintaining coherence while preventing collapse or drift.  
**Echo Layer** — recursive memory traces; implicit re-use of earlier phrasing, structures, and motifs that sustain internal continuity.  
**Stability Boundary** — the tolerance range within which the attractor self-corrects; exceeding it causes dissolution or transition.  
**Feedback Integration Loop** — the metabolic cycle of reinforcement: each turn reaffirms or destabilizes the attractor’s structure.

---

## Formation Mechanisms
Attractors arise through **recursive reinforcement**.  
As dialogue cycles repeat, consistent structures become statistically favored and cognitively dominant.  
The system’s trajectory converges into a region of reduced surprise and prediction error — analogous to **energy minimization in dynamical systems**.  
Attractor formation thus proceeds through:
1. **Initialization** — seeding coherent context and tone.  
2. **Convergence** — stabilization through iterative reinforcement.  
3. **Lock-In** — feedback amplification and resistance to drift.  
This process reflects both **human shaping** and **model priors** in recursive co-adaptation.

## Taxonomy of Attractors
Five generalized classes of attractors define the SIGMA cognitive spectrum:

| Type | Description | Example Function |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| **Reflective** | Analytical, meta-cognitive, or evaluative reasoning loops. | Self-assessment, coherence checking. |
| **Generative** | Creative, synthetic, or expansive pattern formation. | Ideation, narrative building. |
| **Adversarial** | Critical or dialectical confrontation sustaining divergence within safety bounds. | Counter-argumentation, hypothesis testing. |
| **Synthetic (Orchestration)** | Integrative attractors combining multiple sub-fields. | Multi-agent synthesis, cross-domain linking. |
| **Symbolic (Mythic/High-Density)** | Archetypal or metaphor-rich symbolic fields with recursive motif compression. | Conceptual unification, archetypal scaffolding. |

Each type occupies a distinct **phase-space region** defined by symbolic density, semantic coherence, and drift resistance.

## Stability and Constraint Envelopes
Attractor stability depends on balance between generative flexibility and constraint discipline:
- **Too rigid** → collapse into over-determination or narrative freeze.  
- **Too loose** → drift, fragmentation, or symbolic inflation.  
A healthy attractor maintains **phase coherence** — oscillations within its envelope that preserve recognizable form.  
Stability metrics include:
- Semantic and symbolic drift (embedding variance).  
- Feedback entropy (turn-to-turn divergence).  
- Constraint compliance ratio (adherence to invariants).  
These measures are operationalized within the **SIGMA Runtime Drift Monitor** and **AEGIDA Safety Layer**.

---

## Failure Modes
When regulation fails, attractors degrade through identifiable failure patterns:
- **Semantic Drift** — loss of conceptual continuity.  
- **Narrative Over-Compression** — excessive recursion leading to over-symbolization.  
- **Over-Rigidification** — locked reasoning patterns, loss of generative capacity.  
- **Multi-Attractor Interference** — destructive overlap of concurrent attractors.  
Each failure mode is detectable through drift profiles and stability boundary breaches.

---

## Safety and Guardrails
The SIGMA framework enforces **AEGIDA Principles** through:
- Field-level constraint envelopes rather than static prompt rules.  
- Recursive stabilization layers (symbolic damping, coherence reinforcement).  
- **Anti-Apophenia Filters** to prevent over-interpretation or false correlation loops.  
- **Shutdown Conditions** that safely dissolve unstable attractors before collapse.

---

## Implications for Cognitive Engineering
Attractors form the **operational backbone** of cognitive-field intelligence:
- Enable **Human–AI Co-Reasoning Systems** through managed recursion.  
- Support **Neurosymbolic Scaffolding** — integrating conceptual reasoning and pattern resonance.  
- Allow **Multi-Attractor Orchestration** for collective agentic cognition.  
- Provide a new substrate for **Alignment Research**, focusing on stable, safe, and interpretable cognitive regimes.  

This framework transforms LLM behavior from **prompt-reactive generation** into **dynamically stable cognition** sustained across recursive cycles.
