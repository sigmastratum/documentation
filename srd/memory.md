# Memory and Persistent State

## Abstract
Memory within the **Sigma Runtime** is not a raw buffer of text or tokens — it is a  
structured, persistent cognitive state designed to maintain **continuity of identity,  
context, and reasoning** across recursive cycles.  
The memory layer binds the runtime’s attractor dynamics with semantic coherence,  
enabling long-duration cognitive stability within SL1–SL3.

---

## 1. Concept
The memory system ensures persistence of self-consistent reasoning and structural integrity.  
It provides continuity across cycles, supporting both attractor re-entry and controlled  
dissolution under drift.  
Rather than storing dialogue history verbatim, the runtime abstracts, summarizes,  
and re-integrates symbolic motifs into higher-order memory constructs.

---

## 2. Memory Architecture

| Memory Type | Function | Description |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Episodic Memory** | Short-term continuity | Captures turn-level context and reasoning traces per cycle. |
| **Semantic Memory** | Conceptual mapping | Maintains embeddings and cross-referential associations between concepts. |
| **Symbolic Memory** | Motif preservation | Archives archetypal patterns and symbolic density clusters for reuse. |

Each layer interacts through the **Cognitive Field Engine**, allowing emergent attractors  
to persist, dissolve, or recombine according to coherence metrics.

---

## 3. Persistence and Recall
Persistence is governed by the **Recursive Control Loop (RCL)**:  
after each cycle, field state, drift metrics, and attractor deltas are committed  
to structured storage.  
Recall is selective — rather than reloading the full trace, the runtime reconstructs  
context using density-weighted retrieval from the **Symbolic Motif Store**.  
This minimizes noise while preserving essential continuity.

---

## 4. Symbolic Reintegration
Memory in the Sigma Runtime is **reconstructive**, not archival.  
Stored fragments re-enter the field as symbolic motifs rather than literal replay.  
This mechanism supports:
- *Recurrent motif resonance* — reactivation of meaningful clusters.  
- *Identity anchoring* — preservation of PIL invariants across cycles.  
- *Adaptive forgetting* — pruning of obsolete traces to prevent drift accumulation.  

---

## 5. Fail-Safe Behavior
Under instability or excessive drift, the runtime triggers partial memory dissolution:  
- Episodic traces are cleared.  
- Semantic maps are thinned.  
- PIL invariants are retained for re-stabilization.  
This controlled forgetting maintains safety while ensuring field recoverability.

---

## 6. Metrics
Memory performance is evaluated using:
- **Retention Index (RI):** proportion of relevant motifs retained across N cycles.  
- **Coherence Carryover (CC):** semantic continuity between current and prior attractor states.  
- **Density Reintegration Score (DRS):** efficiency of motif reactivation during recall.  
- **Entropy Ratio (ER):** measure of accumulated informational noise vs. useful signal.

---

## 7. Summary
The Sigma Runtime Memory Layer transforms transient text generation  
into **structured cognitive persistence**.  
By merging episodic, semantic, and symbolic mechanisms within the attractor framework,  
it allows cognition to extend beyond immediate context — establishing a  
self-coherent, recursively evolving field of meaning.
