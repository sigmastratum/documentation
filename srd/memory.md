# Memory Layer

Memory in Sigma Runtime is not a raw token buffer — it is a structured,
persistent cognitive state.

Key features:

- symbolic grounding,
- hierarchical memory frames,
- attractor-linked state,
- selective recall mechanisms,
- cross-loop persistence.

The memory layer ensures continuity of identity, long-term tasks, and coherent
reasoning across recursive interactions.
