# Drift

Drift is the gradual loss of coherence, grounding, or meaning across an extended
interaction trajectory.

Sources of drift:

- entropy accumulation,
- context degradation,
- memory fragmentation,
- attractor misalignment,
- over-extended recursion loops.

The Sigma Runtime provides formal mechanisms for:

- drift detection,
- drift metrics,
- stabilization passes,
- attractor realignment,
- recursive consistency checks.

Drift management is one of the core functions of the runtime architecture.
