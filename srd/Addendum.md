## Abstract

This addendum situates **Sigma Stratum (2025–2026)** within the historical development of attractor-based models of cognition.

From Hofstadter’s recursive self-reference (1979), through Hopfield’s neural energy landscapes (1982), the extended cognition thesis (1998), and the neurobiological attractor synthesis of Deco & Rolls (2005), to modern Hopfield networks and transformer dynamics (2005–2025), attractor theory has progressively evolved across philosophy, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.

Sigma Stratum does not introduce a new attractor theory.  
Instead, it operationalizes attractor-inspired stabilization mechanisms at the **runtime layer** of large language model (LLM) interaction loops, focusing on long-horizon semantic coherence in human–AI systems.

## 1. Early Foundations

### 1.1 Recursive Self-Reference (Hofstadter, 1979)

In *Gödel, Escher, Bach*, Douglas Hofstadter described consciousness as arising from recursive symbolic self-reference (“strange loops”).

This work framed cognition as a dynamical structure grounded in recursion.  
Sigma Stratum inherits recursion not as metaphor, but as a control structure in iterative reasoning cycles.

---

### 1.2 Neural Energy Landscapes (Hopfield, 1982)

Hopfield formalized neural networks as dynamical systems minimizing an energy function, where stable attractor states correspond to stored memories.

This introduced:

- convergence in state space  
- stability under perturbation  
- memory as attractor equilibrium  

Sigma Stratum extends the attractor metaphor into the semantic domain, treating long-form reasoning trajectories as stabilization processes in symbolic interaction space.

---

## 2. Distributed Cognition (Clark & Chalmers, 1998)

The Extended Mind thesis proposed that cognition can extend beyond the biological brain into tools and environments.

Human–LLM systems instantiate this coupling concretely.  
Sigma Stratum treats human–LLM dialogue as a coupled dynamical system rather than a unidirectional tool interaction.

---

## 3. Neurobiological Attractor Consolidation (Deco & Rolls, 2005)

Deco & Rolls (2005) provided a unified attractor framework linking:

- attention  
- working memory  
- action selection  

through recurrent cortical networks stabilizing in metastable attractor states.

This work consolidated attractor theory at the neurobiological level.

Sigma Stratum does not reinterpret neural attractors.  
It draws an analogy: extended dialogue coherence in LLM systems exhibits stabilization patterns that can be described in attractor-like terms.

---

## 4. Expansion of Attractor Theory (2005–2025)

The period 2005–2025 marked substantial development in both biological and artificial systems.

### 4.1 Modern Hopfield Networks (2016–2020)

Krotov & Hopfield introduced dense associative memories (“modern Hopfield networks”) with:

- exponential storage capacity  
- continuous state updates  
- sharper energy landscapes  

Ramsauer et al. (2020) demonstrated that transformer self-attention can be interpreted as a modern Hopfield update rule under certain approximations.

This established that attractor-like mechanisms are embedded in transformer architectures.

---

### 4.2 Transformers as Dynamical Systems (2020–2025)

Recent analyses treat transformers as high-dimensional dynamical systems:

- residual stream trajectories  
- structured latent-space geometry  
- metastable or attractor-like convergence behavior  

Research modeling transformers as dynamical systems suggests that internal representations evolve along structured trajectories rather than static feed-forward passes.

This reframing supports the view that LLM reasoning involves dynamical stabilization phenomena at the representational level.

---

### 4.3 Large-Scale Brain and Connectome Models

Deco and collaborators extended attractor modeling to whole-brain dynamics:

- metastability and criticality  
- ghost attractors  
- functional connectome-based Hopfield models  

These works integrated empirical neuroimaging data with large-scale dynamical simulations, reinforcing attractor theory as a cross-scale explanatory framework.

---

## 5. Position of Sigma Stratum

Sigma Stratum does not modify transformer weights or introduce new neural attractor mathematics.

Its contribution lies at a different level:

1. Framing extended human–LLM dialogue as a dynamical coherence problem.
2. Introducing external runtime stabilization mechanisms.
3. Defining measurable drift and stability metrics across long interaction cycles.
4. Demonstrating bounded oscillatory stabilization in multi-hundred-cycle experiments.

The **SIGMA Runtime** operates as an orchestration layer over existing LLMs, aiming to:

- reduce semantic drift  
- maintain structural and identity coherence  
- prevent collapse or rigid crystallization  

This is an engineering synthesis built on established dynamical ideas rather than a foundational theoretical breakthrough.

## 6. Conceptual Comparison

| Domain | Core Mechanism | Substrate | Level |
|--------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| Hopfield (1982) | Energy minimization | Neural network | Internal dynamics |
| Deco & Rolls (2005) | Recurrent attractor stabilization | Cortical circuits | Biological |
| Modern Hopfield (2016–2020) | Continuous associative memory | Deep networks | Architectural |
| Transformer dynamics (2020–2025) | Latent-space trajectories | LLM residual stream | Representational |
| Sigma Stratum (2025) | Runtime semantic stabilization | Human–LLM loop | External orchestration |

---

## 7. Scope and Limitations

Sigma Stratum:

- does not claim theoretical priority  
- does not redefine transformer mathematics  
- does not replace neural-level dynamical modeling  

Its scope is operational:

- long-session stability  
- recursive coherence regulation  
- runtime-level semantic control  

Its value should be evaluated empirically in practical long-horizon interaction settings.

---

## 8. Conclusion

Attractor dynamics have evolved across philosophy, neuroscience, and machine learning over decades.

Sigma Stratum belongs to this lineage as a runtime-oriented applied framework that explores semantic stabilization in extended human–LLM interaction loops.

Its contribution, if validated broadly, lies in translating established dynamical principles into an operational layer for long-horizon AI interaction design.
