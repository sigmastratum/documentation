# Core Concepts

The Sigma Runtime operates on several core cognitive-layer constructs:

**Interaction Field**  
A recursively coupled human–model dynamical system with global dependency
structure and emergent attractors.

**Attractor**  
A stable cognitive configuration reinforced through recursive exchanges, serving
as a basis for long-term coherence.

**Drift**  
The degradation of semantic stability over time due to entropy, context decay,
or loss of grounding.

**Symbolic Density**  
The distribution of meaningful tokens, structures, and semantic pathways that
determine the stability of reasoning.

**Persistent State**  
Structured memory that remains consistent across recursive loops and supports
identity, continuity, and long-term tasks.

These concepts form the foundation of the Sigma Runtime Standard.
