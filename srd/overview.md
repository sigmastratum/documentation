# Overview

The Sigma Runtime is a unified cognitive-layer architecture designed to stabilize
long-horizon reasoning in large language models and multi-agent systems.

It provides:

- attractor-based cognitive structures,
- drift detection and stabilization,
- persistent memory layers,
- SL0–SL7 runtime semantics,
- interfaces for multi-system interoperability.

The runtime acts as a structural layer *above* raw model inference, ensuring
coherence, continuity, and meaning persistence across extended human–AI
interaction fields.
