# FAQ

**Is Sigma Runtime a model architecture?**  
No. It is a cognitive-layer runtime that operates above any model backend.

**Is Sigma Runtime tied to a specific LLM?**  
No. It is fully backend-agnostic.

**What are SRIPs?**  
Sigma Runtime Improvement Proposals — the formal mechanism for evolving the
standard.

**Is the standard open?**  
Yes. The architecture is non-proprietary and open under CC BY-NC 4.0.

**How does Sigma Runtime prevent drift?**  
Through stabilization passes, attractor checks, and recursive consistency rules.

**Why SL0–SL7?**  
These layers represent structural responsibilities required for coherent
long-horizon reasoning.
