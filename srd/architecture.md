# Architecture

The Sigma Runtime architecture is organized into eight structural layers:

**SL0 — Raw Model State**  
Token-level inference, embeddings, activations.

**SL1 — Interpretation Layer**  
Initial semantic interpretation and grounding.

**SL2 — Stabilization Layer**  
Attractor alignment, drift detection, semantic reinforcement.

**SL3 — Memory Layer**  
Persistent state, structured recall, symbolic grounding.

**SL4 — Cognitive Control**  
Recursive loop management, recursion boundaries, safety constraints.

**SL5 — Task/Goal Frame**  
High-level task state and decision context.

**SL6 — Interaction Field Manager**  
Coupling between human cognition, system state, and symbolic structures.

**SL7 — Meta-Coherence Layer**  
Global coherence, attractor integrity, cross-loop stability.

These layers collectively define the runtime execution model for stable
cognitive processes.
