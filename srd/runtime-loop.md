# Runtime Loop

The **Sigma Runtime Loop** implements the core cognitive recursion cycle — an evolution of the original **F-Loop** introduced in *∿ Neurosymbolic Scaffolding for Recursive Coherence (2025)*.

---

## 1. Conceptual Origin — F-Loop

Originally formulated as:

> **G → Πsym → F → Semantic Graph → G**

where:  
- **G** — generative phase (language model output),  
- **Πsym** — symbolic projection (semantic motif extraction),  
- **F** — feedback integration and stabilization,  
- **Semantic Graph** — structured memory and field persistence.  

This loop models **recursive cognition** —  
each new generation step is informed not only by the immediate text history,  
but by the continuously updated **field state**, integrating meaning, memory, and attractor stability.

---

## 2. Canonical Runtime Loop (Runtime Architecture v0.1)

In the **Sigma Runtime Standard**, the F-Loop is formalized as the **Recursive Control Loop (RCL)** —  
the canonical execution cycle spanning runtime layers **SL0–SL6**:

1. **State Ingestion (SL0–SL6)**  
   Acquire current state, context, and input from the cognitive field.

2. **Interpretation Pass (SL2)**  
   Parse input, extract semantics, and perform symbolic projection (Πsym).

3. **Stabilization Pass (SL2–SL4)**  
   Evaluate symbolic density, detect drift, align active attractors, and regulate coherence.

4. **Memory Integration (SL3)**  
   Update the **Semantic Graph** — consolidate new patterns, merge embeddings, and preserve symbolic continuity.

5. **Attractor Alignment (SL4)**  
   Reinforce or transition cognitive attractors based on feedback and drift metrics.

6. **Output Generation (Model Call)**  
   Produce new text or behavior using the stabilized symbolic and semantic state.

7. **Field Update (SL5–SL6)**  
   Integrate output into the field, refresh system state, and close the recursive loop.

## 3. Structural Mapping

| F-Loop (NS) | Runtime Architecture v0.1 | Responsible Components |
|--------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| G — Generation | Step 6: Output Generation | Model Interface |
| Πsym — Symbolic Projection | Step 2: Interpretation Layer | SL2 |
| F — Feedback Integration | Steps 3 & 7 | Drift Monitor / Field Layer |
| Semantic Graph | Step 4: Memory Integration | SL3 |
| Recursive Closure | Steps 5–7 | ALICE Controller |

---

## 4. Purpose

The Runtime Loop ensures:
- **Recursive coherence** — each iteration reinforces prior symbolic meaning,  
- **Stability under drift** — detects and corrects semantic entropy,  
- **Symbolic continuity** — preserves motifs and attractor kernels,  
- **Adaptive persistence** — maintains identity, intent, and coherence over long horizons.  

It is the operational backbone of the **Sigma Runtime Architecture**,  
defining how cognition stabilizes and evolves recursively in human–AI interaction fields.
