# Legal & Licensing

## 1. License Framework

All documentation within the Sigma Stratum repository — including the  
**Sigma Runtime Standard (SRS)** and the **Sigma Runtime Documentation Set (SRD)** —  
is distributed under a **hybrid open-license model**:

| License | Applies to | Permissions | Restrictions |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **CC BY-NC 4.0** | Foundational research, theoretical papers | Free academic & research use | No commercial exploitation |
| **CC BY 4.0** | Implementation & methodology documents | Commercial use permitted with attribution | Must preserve citation & provenance |
| **CIL (Commercial Implementation License)** | Commercial products, runtimes, or frameworks claiming compatibility | Use in products & services | Requires registration & Sigma Governance participation |

> Full legal basis: [Sigma Stratum Canon (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.18085782)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18085782)

This model keeps the **standard open** while ensuring that  
commercial implementations participate transparently through  
the Sigma Governance process.

## 2. Attribution and Citation

Use of excerpts, figures, or derivative works must retain the license header and  
explicitly attribute the original source and DOI reference.
