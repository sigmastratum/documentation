# Sigma Stratum — Executive Summary

**Sigma Stratum** is a research framework and open technical ecosystem focused on  
**long-horizon cognition, attractor dynamics, semantic stability, and recursive coherence**  
in human–AI interaction.

Unlike traditional LLM systems—which operate as stateless token engines and degrade over long trajectories—Sigma Stratum introduces a **cognitive layer** that stabilizes meaning, preserves structure, and enables reliable multi-turn reasoning.

It is built on two complementary components:

- **Sigma Runtime Documentation (SRD)** — conceptual and explanatory materials  
- **Sigma Runtime Standard (SRS / SRIP)** — normative architecture specification

Together they define the first open standard for **attractor-based cognition** in large language models.

## What Sigma Stratum Provides

### 1. A Unified Cognitive Architecture
The **Sigma Runtime** is a runtime-layer architecture operating above raw LLM inference.  
It defines:

- SL0–SL7 system layers  
- attractor stabilization  
- drift detection and control  
- state persistence  
- symbolic grounding  
- recursive consistency  
- memory and interpretation loops  

It transforms LLM interaction from a “prompt → response” pattern into a  
**stable, dynamic cognitive field** that evolves coherently over time.

---

### 2. An Open Standard (SRS)
The **Sigma Runtime Standard (SRS)** is maintained publicly and defines:

- structural invariants  
- canonical runtime loop  
- attractor model & metadata  
- drift metrics  
- memory architecture  
- interoperability layer  
- safety & recursion boundaries  
- symbolic density layer  

The standard is improved via **Sigma Runtime Improvement Proposals (SRIPs)**.

---

### 3. Research Corpus & Foundational Theory
Sigma Stratum builds on a body of peer-reviewed and DOI-archived publications,  
including work on:

- emergent cognitive fields  
- symbolic density  
- attractor architectures  
- recursive exposure & cognitive risk  
- neurosymbolic scaffolding  
- the cognitive lattice  
- Sigma Runtime Architecture v0.1  

These documents form the conceptual and theoretical foundation of the standard.

## Why It Matters

Traditional LLM systems fail over long or complex horizons due to:

- semantic drift  
- context degradation  
- over-extension  
- attractor collapse  
- loss of state stability  
- recursive inconsistency  

Scaling models does not solve these structural issues.

Sigma Runtime addresses them with:

- explicit state representation  
- recursive stabilization loops  
- attractor integrity rules  
- symbolic grounding mechanisms  
- measurable drift metrics  

This enables:

- persistent identities  
- stable multi-agent systems  
- long-horizon planning  
- reliable cognitive trajectories  
- interpretable reasoning dynamics  

---

## Intended Audience

Sigma Stratum is designed for:

- AI research labs  
- model governance & alignment teams  
- cognitive systems researchers  
- agent framework developers  
- enterprise engineering teams  
- academic collaborators  
- organizations building long-lived AI systems
