# Sigma Stratum — Executive Summary

**Sigma Stratum** is an open research framework and technical standardization effort  
focused on **long-horizon cognition, attractor dynamics, semantic stability, and recursive coherence**  
in human–AI interaction.

Traditional LLMs behave as stateless token engines and degrade over long trajectories.  
Sigma Stratum introduces a **cognitive-layer runtime** that stabilizes meaning, preserves structure,  
and enables persistent, interpretable reasoning across recursive cycles.

It is organized into two complementary components:

- **Sigma Runtime Documentation (SRD)** — conceptual and explanatory corpus  
- **Sigma Runtime Standard (SRS / SRIP)** — normative technical specification  

Together they define the world’s first open standard for **attractor-based cognition** in LLM-mediated systems.

## What Sigma Stratum Provides

### 1 · A Unified Cognitive Architecture
The **Sigma Runtime** operates as a cognitive substrate above model inference,  
defining the structural and semantic mechanisms of stable reasoning.

It formalizes:
- SL0–SL6 layered runtime model  
- attractor stabilization & integrity  
- drift detection and adaptive correction  
- state persistence & memory architecture  
- symbolic grounding & field topology  
- recursive coherence & feedback control  

It transforms the “prompt → response” pattern into a  
**self-regulating cognitive field** capable of long-duration operation.

---

### 2 · An Open Standard (SRS)
The **Sigma Runtime Standard (SRS)** defines the canonical runtime semantics and safety envelopes for attractor-based cognition.  
It is published as a modular series of **Sigma Runtime Improvement Proposals (SRIPs)**.

**Active SRIPs (v0.2):**
- SRIP-00 — Foundations and Scope  
- SRIP-01 — Canonical Runtime Loop  
- SRIP-02 — Attractor State Model & Metadata  
- SRIP-03 — Drift Metrics & Stabilization Algorithms  
- SRIP-04 — Memory Layer Architecture  
- SRIP-05 — Interoperability Interface v1.0  
- SRIP-06 — Safety & Recursion Boundaries  
- SRIP-07 — Symbolic Density Layer  
- SRIP-08 — Phase-Regulating Runtime Module (ALICE Externalization)  

Each SRIP contributes to the unified **Sigma Runtime Standard (SRS v0.2)** —  
the formal blueprint for building coherent, safe, and interpretable cognitive runtimes.

---

### 3 · Research Corpus & Foundational Theory
Sigma Stratum builds upon a growing peer-reviewed corpus, including:
- *Attractor Architectures in LLM-Mediated Cognitive Fields*  
- *Neurosymbolic Scaffolding for Recursive Coherence*  
- *Attractor Drift and Field Stability in Interactive Cognition*  
- *SIGMA Runtime Architecture v0.1*  
- *SIGMA Runtime v0.4.6 — Adaptive Phase Regulation and AEGIDA-2*  

This theoretical base defines the attractor framework and recursive control principles  
that underlie the runtime standard.

## Why It Matters

Conventional LLMs fail over long or complex horizons due to:
- semantic drift  
- context decay  
- over-expansion  
- attractor collapse  
- memory fragmentation  
- recursive instability  

Scaling models does **not** solve these structural problems.

Sigma Runtime addresses them through:
- explicit cognitive state representation  
- recursive stabilization passes  
- attractor coherence management  
- symbolic grounding & density control  
- measurable drift and stability metrics  

Resulting in:
- persistent cognitive identities  
- multi-agent coherence  
- safe long-horizon planning  
- interpretable emergent reasoning  

---

## Intended Audience

Sigma Stratum serves:
- AI research & alignment laboratories  
- cognitive architecture developers  
- agent framework and runtime engineers  
- academic researchers in semantics and dynamical cognition  
- governance & safety organizations  
- distributed system architects building autonomous agents
