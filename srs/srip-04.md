# SRIP-04: Memory Layer Architecture

**Status:** Draft  
**Category:** Cognitive Memory  

SRIP-04 specifies:

- memory frame structure  
- persistence rules  
- recall mechanisms  
- grounding and symbolic anchoring  
- invariants for long-horizon reasoning  

Memory is treated as a structured cognitive state, not a raw transcript buffer.
