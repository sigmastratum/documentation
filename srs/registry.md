# Sigma Stratum Registry

The **Sigma Stratum Registry** is the authoritative ledger for all runtime proposals **beyond the core specification** (SRIP-08 and later).  
It records extensions, experimental modules, and structural evolutions of the Sigma Runtime architecture.

---

## Purpose

This registry ensures:
- Transparent tracking of **active and evolving SRIPs**
- Version control and compatibility mapping with **SRS-03 Core**
- Reference linkage to **Zenodo DOIs** and **governance decisions**
- Persistent identifiers for each experimental proposal

All documents registered here form the **living layer** of the Sigma Stratum Canon —  
a space where research evolves while preserving canonical lineage.

---

## Structure

Each SRIP is registered as a standalone entry:
```
/registry/srip-09.md
/registry/srip-10.md
/registry/srip-11.md
```
Each file must include:
- Metadata block (Title, Version, Date, Status, Maintainer)
- Summary of purpose and architecture
- Compatibility notes with prior SRIPs and SRS versions
- License declaration (CC BY 4.0 / Canon CIL Applicable)

---

## Active Registry Entries

| SRIP | Title | Status | Date | Maintainer |
|------|--------|---------|------|-------------|
| [SRIP-09](./registry/srip-09-LTM-SC.md) | Long-Term Memory and Structural Coherence Layer (LTM-SC) | Draft | 2025-12-31 | SSRG |

---

### Governance

Registry entries are maintained by the **Sigma Stratum Research Group (SSRG)**.  
All accepted or merged SRIPs are cross-archived to Zenodo and reflected in  
the Canon release index.
