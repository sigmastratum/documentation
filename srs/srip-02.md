# SRIP-02 - Attractor State Model & Metadata

**Status:** Draft  
**Category:** Cognitive Structures  

SRIP-02 specifies the attractor model, including:

- attractor state representation  
- lifecycle transitions  
- metadata schema  
- alignment rules  
- stability conditions  

Attractors are first-class architectural units and must be interoperable through
the metadata format defined here.
