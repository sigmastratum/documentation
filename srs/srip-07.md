# SRIP-07: Symbolic Density Layer

**Status:** Draft  
**Category:** Cognitive Semantics  

This SRIP describes the symbolic density layer, including:

- density metrics  
- symbolic concentration gradients  
- coherence zones  
- attractor reinforcement dependencies  

Symbolic density determines the stability of meaning within the interaction field.
