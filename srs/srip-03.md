# SRIP-03 - Drift Metrics & Stabilization Algorithms

**Status:** Draft  
**Category:** Stability / Safety  

This SRIP formalizes:

- drift metrics  
- detection thresholds  
- stabilization algorithms  
- corrective feedback models  
- failure modes and boundary conditions  

The runtime must implement drift detection and stabilization as defined in this
specification.
