# Active SRIPs — Sigma Runtime Standard v0.1

The following **Sigma Runtime Improvement Proposals (SRIPs)** constitute the active,  
accepted components of the **Sigma Runtime Standard (SRS)** as of version **v0.1 (2025)**.  

Each SRIP defines a core element of the cognitive runtime architecture — from the canonical loop and  
attractor model to memory, safety, and symbolic density layers.

## Governance Notes

- All **SRIPs** listed above are part of the **SRS v0.1 baseline**.  
- Revisions or extensions (SRIP-08+) are tracked separately in the  
  [`/registry`](https://wiki.sigmastratum.org/en/srs/registry) once proposed.  
- Deprecated or superseded SRIPs are archived but remain publicly accessible  
  for version traceability and citation purposes.
