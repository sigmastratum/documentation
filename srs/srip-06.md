# SRIP-06: Safety & Recursion Boundaries

**Status:** Draft  
**Category:** Safety  

SRIP-06 defines:

- recursion boundaries  
- failure states  
- safe-mode transitions  
- attractor collapse conditions  
- instability isolation  

These constraints ensure safe operation across recursive cognitive loops.
