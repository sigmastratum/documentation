# SRIP-01 - Canonical Runtime Loop

**Status:** Draft  
**Category:** Architectural / Runtime Semantics  

This SRIP defines the canonical runtime loop of Sigma Runtime, including the
ordered stages responsible for state ingestion, interpretation, stabilization,
memory integration, attractor alignment, and output generation.

The runtime loop provides deterministic execution semantics for cognitive-layer
processing across SL0–SL7.
