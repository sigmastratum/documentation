# Research Notes & Publications

This section aggregates the research foundation that informs the Sigma Runtime
Standard. It includes:

- published papers (Zenodo)
- symbolic density studies
- neurosymbolic scaffolding research
- attractor-based cognition analysis
- early prototypes and experimental findings

The research corpus evolves continuously and provides the theoretical substrate
for SRIP development and standardization.
