# Research Notes & Publications

This section aggregates the research foundation that informs the 
**Sigma Runtime Standard (SRS)** and the broader Sigma Stratum project.  
It includes:

- archived research publications (Zenodo)  
- symbolic density and neurosymbolic scaffolding studies  
- attractor-based cognition analysis  
- early prototypes and experimental frameworks  
- foundational theoretical documents

The research corpus evolves continuously and provides the **theoretical substrate**
from which SRIPs, the Sigma Runtime Standard, and the Sigma Runtime
Documentation (SRD) are derived.

### **Sigma Runtime – Experimental Iterations (SR-EI Series)**
**Repository:** [https://github.com/sigmastratum/documentation/tree/main/sigma-runtime](https://github.com/sigmastratum/documentation/tree/main/sigma-runtime)

This sequence of experimental reports documents the iterative engineering validation of the Sigma Runtime architecture between versions 0.3.5 and 0.4.6.

- **[SR-EI-03 – Benchmark Report (v0.3.5)](https://github.com/sigmastratum/documentation/blob/05a8dc7554813a5fc32169ac7d70e5584cc94782/sigma-runtime/SR-EI-03/benchmark_report_SR_v035.md)**  
  *First public benchmark cycle validating drift stability, attractor persistence, and field coherence across 80+ recursive iterations.*

- **[SR-EI-037 – Control & Validation Report (v0.3.7)](https://github.com/sigmastratum/documentation/blob/05a8dc7554813a5fc32169ac7d70e5584cc94782/sigma-runtime/SR-EI-037/SIGMA_Runtime_0_3_7_CVR.md)**  
  *Confirms recursive control loop consistency and symbolic density thresholds; introduces baseline for adaptive phase regulation.*

- **[SR-EI-046 – Validation Report (v0.4.6)](https://github.com/sigmastratum/documentation/blob/05a8dc7554813a5fc32169ac7d70e5584cc94782/sigma-runtime/SR-EI-046/SIGMA_Runtime_v046_VALIDATION_REPORT.md)**  
  *Final experimental validation for v0.4.6, integrating ALICE Phase Controller and AEGIDA-2 safety framework. Demonstrates autonomous phase containment, drift recovery, and long-horizon coherence.*

Together, these experimental iterations verify the theoretical foundations established in  
[**SIGMA Runtime Architecture v0.1**](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17703667),  
providing empirical evidence for attractor-based cognition and recursive field stability.
