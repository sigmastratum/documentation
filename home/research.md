# Research Notes & Publications

This section aggregates the research foundation that informs the **Sigma Runtime
Standard (SRS)** and the broader Sigma Stratum project.  
It includes:

- peer-reviewed and archived publications (Zenodo)  
- symbolic density and neurosymbolic scaffolding studies  
- attractor-based cognition analysis  
- early prototypes and experimental frameworks  
- foundational theoretical documents

The research corpus evolves continuously and provides the **theoretical substrate**
from which SRIPs, the Sigma Runtime Standard, and the Sigma Runtime
Documentation (SRD) are derived.
