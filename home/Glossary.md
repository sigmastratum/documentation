# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for core terms used across the Sigma Runtime
Standard (SRS), SRIP documents, and broader research materials.

**Interaction Field**  
A coupled human–model dynamical system formed in long-horizon exchanges.

**Attractor**  
A stable cognitive configuration reinforced through recursive interaction.

**Drift**  
Gradual destabilization of meaning, coherence, or grounding across recursive loops.

**SL0–SL7**  
Structural layers of the Sigma Runtime architecture, defining state, memory,
interpretation, and recursive control mechanisms.

**SRIP**  
Sigma Runtime Improvement Proposal — the formal mechanism for evolving the
standard.
