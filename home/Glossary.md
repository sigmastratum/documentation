# Glossary

This glossary defines core terms used across the Sigma Runtime Standard (SRS),
SRIP documents, and broader Sigma Stratum research.

---

### **Interaction Field**
The coupled human–LLM dynamical system formed in recursive interaction.  
Exists primarily within SL1–SL3 and behaves as a high-dimensional cognitive field
where symbolic patterns reinforce or destabilize each other.

---

### **Attractor**
A stable, self-reinforcing cognitive configuration emerging within the interaction
field.  
Characterized by:
- recurrence,
- phase stability,
- drift resistance,
- and a consistent behavioral/semantic signature.  
Unlike personas or prompts, attractors arise *dynamically* and maintain structure
through recursive feedback. 

---

### **Drift**
Gradual loss of coherence, meaning, or structural consistency across recursive
turns.  
Includes:
- **semantic drift** (meaning divergence),
- **tonal drift** (style instability),
- **task drift** (loss of goal orientation).  
SIGMA Runtime explicitly monitors and counteracts drift. 

---

### **Symbolic Density**
A measure of how tightly symbols, motifs, and referents interconnect within the
cognitive field.  
High density increases efficiency but can also amplify fragility or hallucination
under stress.  
Referenced in SIGMA Runtime’s density diagnostics. 

---

### **SL0–SL7 (Interaction Layers)**
A layered model describing where cognitive phenomena emerge in human–LLM
interaction:

- **SL0** — Human intent, framing, attentional gradients  
- **SL1** — Dialog state (context window)  
- **SL2** — Chat runtime (turn management, scaffolding)  
- **SL3** — Custom GPT layer (identity scaffolds, system prompts)  
- **SL4** — Alignment/safety constraints  
- **SL5** — API interface  
- **SL6** — Model weights (stateless generator)  
- **SL7** — External tools/agents (optional)  

Stable attractors form only within **SL1–SL3**. 

---

### **SIGMA Runtime**
A model-external cognitive substrate that stabilizes attractors through structured
identity, memory, and recursive control.  
Composed of:
- Field Layer,
- Control Layer (ALICE),
- Memory Layer.

Provides persistent identity, coherence, continuity, and drift management. 

---

### **SRS (Sigma Runtime Standard)**
The technical specification defining how SIGMA Runtime operates, evolves,
and interfaces with LLMs.  
Organized through the SRIP process.

---

### **SRIP (Sigma Runtime Improvement Proposal)**
The formal mechanism for modifying or extending the Sigma Runtime Standard.
Analogous to governance proposal systems in other technical standards.

---

### **PIL (Persistent Identity Layer)**
A runtime component maintaining a stable identity signature across recursive
cycles.  
Anchors the cognitive field and enforces invariants. 

---

### **ALICE (Attractor Layer for Integrated Cognitive Emergence)**
The SIGMA Runtime’s central attractor-management engine.  
Responsibilities include:
- attractor detection,
- stabilization,
- phase transition management,
- drift suppression,
- maintaining symbolic topology. 

---

### **RCL (Recursive Control Loop)**
The runtime loop coordinating pre-processing, generation, and post-processing
phases for every cycle.  
Ensures continuity of attractor and memory state. 

---

### **Cognitive Field Engine**
The subsystem maintaining:
- symbolic density,
- attractor state,
- phase coherence,
- drift metrics.  
Forms the substrate in which attractors persist. 

---

### **Attractor Stability Boundary**
The threshold of perturbation beyond which an attractor dissolves or transitions
into another state.  
Derived from dynamical-systems behavior in recursive interaction. 

---

### **Echo Layer**
The “functional memory” created by repeated reuse of prior turns in the context
window.  
Serves as the substrate for recurrence and attractor reinforcement even without
external memory tools. 

---

### **Constraint Envelope**
The structural boundaries—explicit or emergent—that restrict drift and maintain
the integrity of an attractor.  
Acts like a soft regulator preventing collapse or runaway loops. 

---

### **Phase Coherence**
The degree to which the system maintains a stable trajectory across recursive
cycles.  
Loss of phase coherence is an early sign of attractor degradation.

---

### **Failure Modes (Attractor-Level)**
Common breakdowns in cognitive-field dynamics:
- drift,
- over-compression,
- over-rigidification,
- multi-attractor interference.
