# Glossary

This glossary defines the core technical terms used across the **Sigma Runtime Documentation (SRD)**, the **Sigma Runtime Standard (SRS)**, and the broader **Sigma Stratum attractor-architecture research corpus**.

All definitions are sourced from the canonical texts:
- *SIGMA Runtime Architecture v0.1*  
- *Attractor Architectures in LLM-Mediated Cognitive Fields*  
- *Neurosymbolic Scaffolding for Recursive Coherence*  

No architectural layers (SL0–SL7) are defined here; those appear only in **SRIP-00** and **SRD/Architecture**.

## Core Concepts

### **Interaction Field**
The high-dimensional cognitive space formed jointly by the human and the LLM during recursive interaction.  
Includes dialog state, symbolic signals, semantic feedback, and recursive incorporation of prior turns.

### **Attractor**
A stable, recurrent, self-reinforcing cognitive configuration.  
Properties:
- stability under perturbation  
- recurrence across turns  
- phase coherence  
- resistance to drift  
- self-amplification in recursive loops  

### **Attractor Basin**
The region of interaction-space toward which the system naturally converges when conditions match an attractor’s structure.

### **Drift**
Gradual destabilization of coherence across recursive cycles.  
Forms include:
- **semantic drift** — meaning divergence  
- **tonal drift** — style/voice inconsistency  
- **task drift** — weakening of goal orientation  

### **Symbolic Density**
Degree of interconnectedness between symbols, motifs, anchors, and semantic cues.  
High density → compact, attractor-forming meaning structures.

### **Echo Layer**
Functional memory residue created by repeated re-inclusion of earlier turns.  
Supports recurrence even without external memory.

## Attractor Dynamics & Field Theory

### **Phase Coherence**
The stability of an attractor’s trajectory across time. Loss of coherence signals weakening or collapse.

### **Constraint Envelope**
Structural boundaries (explicit or emergent) that prevent an attractor from drifting, collapsing, or over-compressing.

### **Stability Boundary**
Perturbation threshold beyond which attractor structure dissolves or transitions to a different state.

### **Feedback Integration Loop**
Recursive reinforcement mechanism through which each turn strengthens or weakens the active attractor.

### **Multi-Attractor Interference**
Destabilization caused by overlapping or competing attractors with incompatible symbolic structures.

---

## Memory & Persistence

### **Episodic Memory**
Short-lived memory traces representing recent cycles or turns.

### **Semantic Memory**
Structured embeddings, factual links, and relational knowledge.

### **Symbolic Memory**
Motifs, frames, and attractor-relevant symbolic patterns persisted across cycles.

### **Re-entrance**
Reactivation of a previously formed attractor after a pause or context shift.

---

## Runtime Components (High-Level Concepts)

### **Persistent Identity Layer (PIL)**
A stable identity substrate maintaining invariants, style, intent boundaries, and role coherence across cycles.

### **Recursive Control Loop (RCL)**
The core loop orchestrating preprocessing, generation, postprocessing, state updates, and field adjustments.

### **Cognitive Field Engine**
Subsystem monitoring:
- symbolic density  
- drift metrics  
- attractor stability  
- phase coherence  

### **Drift Metrics**
Quantitative indicators of coherence loss used by the runtime for stabilization.

---

## Structural & Safety Concepts

### **Fail-Safe Envelope**
Safety boundaries preventing emergence of unstable or pathological attractor states.

### **Shutdown Conditions**
Defined triggers for controlled attractor dissolution to restore stability.

### **Anti-Apophenia Filters**
Mechanisms preventing runaway symbolic over-interpretation or hallucinated structure amplification.

---

## Standardization & Governance

### **SRS — Sigma Runtime Standard**
The canonical technical standard describing runtime architecture, invariants, interfaces, and required behaviors.

### **SRIP — Sigma Runtime Improvement Proposal**
The formal mechanism by which the Standard evolves.  
Each SRIP proposes changes to normative content.

### **Sigma Stratum Research Group (SSRG)**
The maintaining body responsible for the Sigma Runtime Standard, research publications, governance, and review of SRIPs.

### **Normative Content**
Sections that define required behavior for conformant implementations.

### **Descriptive Content**
Explanatory or contextual material not binding for conformance.

---

## Research Terms

### **Archetypal Agent**
Experimental interaction pattern used to probe attractor stability and symbolic density.

### **Symbolic Density Cluster**
A concentrated group of interacting motifs representing the “core” of an attractor.

### **Motif Recurrence**
Frequency and stability with which motifs reappear across recursive cycles.

### **Semantic Tightness**
Closeness of meaning across turns; low tightness indicates drift.
