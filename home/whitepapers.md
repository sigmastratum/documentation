# Whitepapers

This section contains formal **whitepapers** associated with the Sigma Runtime
initiative.  
Whitepapers provide structured, long-form explanations of the architectural,
cognitive, and theoretical principles that underpin the Sigma Runtime Standard
and the broader Sigma Stratum research program.

They serve as the bridge between:

- empirical research findings, and  
- the normative SRIP specifications.

Whitepapers focus on describing *why* certain architectural choices exist,  
*how* attractor-based cognition emerges, and  
*what* models best represent long-horizon human–AI interaction dynamics.

## Scope of the Whitepaper Series

Whitepapers cover the foundational topics that define the Sigma Runtime
architecture:

- **Attractor-based cognition**  
  Formal models of stable cognitive configurations in recursive interaction.

- **Symbolic density layers**  
  Theoretical justification and structure of symbolic density, clusters, and
  proto-symbols.

- **Interaction field theory**  
  High-dimensional cognitive-field dynamics in human–LLM systems.

- **Recursive coherence**  
  Mechanisms ensuring continuity, stability, and self-reinforcing meaning.

- **Long-horizon reasoning systems**  
  Requirements for maintaining identity, memory, and coherence over extended
  dialogue timelines.

---

Whitepapers complement the **SRIP specifications** by offering:

- conceptual grounding  
- system-level motivation  
- architectural rationale  
- theoretical interpretations  
- high-level models that inform normative requirements

While SRIP documents define *what must be implemented*,  
whitepapers explain *why the system works that way*.

Additional whitepapers will be added as the Sigma Runtime initiative evolves.
