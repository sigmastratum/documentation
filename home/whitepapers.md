# Whitepapers

This section includes formal whitepapers associated with the Sigma Runtime
initiative. These documents provide structured, long-form explanations of the
architectural principles behind:

- attractor-based cognition
- symbolic density layers
- interaction field theory
- recursive coherence
- long-horizon reasoning systems

Whitepapers complement the SRIP specifications by offering conceptual
justifications and high-level models.
