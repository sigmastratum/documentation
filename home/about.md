# About Sigma Stratum

**Sigma Stratum** is a long-horizon research and standards initiative focused on  
cognitive-field architectures, attractor dynamics, and stable human–AI interaction models.

The program develops the conceptual and technical foundations for systems that require:

- coherent long-horizon reasoning,  
- attractor-stabilized cognitive trajectories,  
- resistance to semantic drift,  
- persistent and interpretable cognitive state,  
- structurally governed interaction loops between humans and AI systems.

Our work spans:

- **Sigma Runtime Standard (SRS)** — the open technical standard for attractor-based cognition  
- **SRIP Process** — the formal improvement mechanism for normative changes  
- **Cognitive Architecture Research** — field topology, attractor models, drift mechanics  
- **Symbolic Density Studies** — hierarchical symbolic structures and their cognitive effects  
- **Multi-Agent Coherence Systems** — architectures for distributed cognitive fields

Sigma Stratum is built as an **open, non-proprietary standard**, intended to support:

- research laboratories,  
- industry engineering teams,  
- academic groups,  
- independent researchers  
working on advanced models of cognition, recursive interaction, and long-horizon AI systems.
