# About Sigma Stratum

Sigma Stratum is a long-horizon research and standards initiative focused on
cognitive-field architectures, attractor dynamics, and stable human–AI
interaction models.

Our work spans:

- Sigma Runtime Standard (SRS)
- SRIP specification process
- cognitive architecture research
- symbolic density studies
- multi-agent coherence systems

The project is built as an open, non-proprietary standard, designed to support
industry, academia, and independent researchers working on advanced AI cognition.
