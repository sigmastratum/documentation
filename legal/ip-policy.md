# IP Policy  
**Sigma Stratum Research Group**  
**Version:** 2025  
**Status:** Authoritative Policy Document  

The Sigma Runtime Standard is an **open, non-proprietary technical standard**.  
This policy defines the intellectual property framework governing all
contributions, extensions, and derivative work related to the Standard.

---

## 1. Ownership of Contributions

Contributors retain **full copyright** to their individual submissions.

By submitting content to the Sigma Runtime Standard or the SRIP process, each
contributor grants the Sigma Stratum Research Group a **perpetual,
irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free license** to:

- publish the contribution,  
- modify and adapt it,  
- distribute it in any form,  
- incorporate it into the Sigma Runtime Standard,  
- create derivative works for the purpose of standardization.  

This applies exclusively to the **standardization context**, not to unrelated
external projects.

---

## 2. Open-Standard Requirement (No Proprietary Forks)

The Sigma Runtime architecture—its definitions, invariants, schemas, and
structural specifications—must remain fully **open and accessible**.

### Prohibited:
- Private or closed-source forks of the **architecture specification**  
- Modified versions of SRS that are distributed under restrictive licenses  
- Attempts to enclose or privatize the Standard  

### Permitted:
- Proprietary or commercial implementations  
- Closed-source runtimes, agents, or tools **built on top of** the open standard  
- Extensions that do not break compatibility with the canonical SRIP process  

The Standard itself must remain open; implementations may be commercial.

---

## 3. License Structure

The Sigma Stratum documentation uses a **multi-license model**:

- **CC BY-NC 4.0** for foundational or non-commercial research documents  
- **CC BY 4.0** for commercially permissive materials  

Each document declares its specific license at the top of the file.  
The license stated in the document itself is **authoritative**.

---

## 4. Third-Party IP Compliance

All contributors must ensure that submitted material:

- is original,  
- does not infringe third-party intellectual property,  
- does not introduce copyrighted text or diagrams without permission,  
- is safe to integrate into an open standard.

Contributors are responsible for verifying that their input is free of external
licensing conflicts.

---

## 5. Trademarks and Symbols

The **∿ symbol**, the term **“Sigma Stratum”**, and the associated visual
identity are protected assets of the Sigma Stratum Research Group.

Permitted use:

- academic publications  
- citation  
- standard-conformant implementations  

Prohibited use:

- misleading branding  
- creating products or services that imply official certification  
- unauthorized commercial branding leveraging the ∿ symbol  

---

## 6. Changes to This Policy

Revisions to the IP Policy follow the same governance path as SRIP updates:

- proposed changes are submitted via pull request,  
- reviewed by the maintainers,  
- approved or rejected based on alignment with the Standard’s goals.
