The Sigma Runtime Standard is an open, non-proprietary technical standard.

### Contributor Rights
Contributors retain copyright to their work but grant the Sigma Stratum Research

- publish,
- modify,
- distribute,
- incorporate contributions into the Standard.

### No Proprietary Forks
The Sigma Runtime architecture must remain open. Private or proprietary forks of
the *architecture specification* are not permitted.

Implementations, however, may be proprietary.

All contributors must ensure that submitted material does not violate third-party
intellectual property rights.
