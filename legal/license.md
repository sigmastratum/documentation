# Licensing and Access Policy

## 1. Open Standard License Model

The **Sigma Runtime Standard (SRS)** and the **Sigma Stratum Documentation Set (SRD)**  
are released under a hybrid open framework combining:

- **Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial 4.0 (CC BY-NC 4.0)** for foundational research documents  
- **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY 4.0)** for commercially-permissive publications  
- **Commercial Implementation License (CIL)** for derivative commercial systems and runtimes  

This structure ensures that the **architecture and documentation remain open**,  
while commercial derivatives are regulated through transparent licensing  
and participation in **Sigma Governance**.

---

## 1.1 Publication Boundary

**SR-EI-037 and earlier**  
Released under **CC BY-NC 4.0** for scientific reproducibility.  
These builds constitute the last publicly available reference implementations.

**Versions after SR-EI-037**  
Are proprietary research builds maintained internally by the Sigma Stratum Research Group.  
They are not publicly distributed.  
The open standard (SRD / SRS / SRIP) remains fully public and reviewable.

---

## 2. Access Letter Program

Organizations and research partners may request participation in  
the **Sigma Stratum Open Standard Access Program**.

Access is formalized through:

> **Sigma Stratum Initiative — Open Standard Access Letter**

This letter:
- Grants non-exclusive R&D rights to use the Sigma Runtime specifications  
- Permits internal tools, prototypes, and research extensions  
- Requires publication of any architectural modifications as **SRIP proposals**  
- Ensures interoperability with the canonical specification  
- Confirms non-transfer of IP ownership  

The letter is **not a contract** and **does not provide exclusivity**.  
It serves as a declaration of participation under the open-standard covenant  
and formal alignment with Sigma Governance.

---

## 3. How to Request an Access Letter

Organizations wishing to participate should send a short inquiry to:

**Sigma Stratum Research Group (SSRG)**  
[legal@sigmastratum.org](mailto:legal@sigmastratum.org)

Please include:
- Organization name and country  
- Contact person and title  
- Intended area of research or integration  
- Optional: planned contribution (research, compute, sponsorship, etc.)

Qualified institutions will receive a countersigned  
**Open Standard Access Letter** for the current governance cycle.

## 4. License Coverage

All Sigma Stratum documents and specifications remain subject to:

- **CC BY-NC 4.0** for foundational research materials  
- **CC BY 4.0** for open commercial-permissive content  
- **Commercial Implementation License (CIL)** for any commercial runtime or derivative system  
- **[/legal/ip-policy.md](https://github.com/sigmastratum/documentation/blob/main/legal/ip-policy.md)** for IP management

> No proprietary or closed-standard forks of the Sigma Runtime architecture  
> are permitted under this license model.  
> Academic, nonprofit, and independent research use remain fully open.
