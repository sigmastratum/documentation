# Licensing and Access Policy

## 1. Open Standard License Model

The **Sigma Runtime Standard (SRS)** and the **Sigma Stratum Documentation Set (SRD)**  
are released under a hybrid open framework combining:

- **Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial 4.0 (CC BY-NC 4.0)** for documentation,  
- **Open Standard Covenant** for architectural specifications.  

This model ensures that the **architecture remains open** and publicly reviewable,  
while implementations and commercial systems may remain proprietary.

---

## 2. Access Letter Program

Organizations and research partners may request official participation in  
the **Sigma Stratum Open Standard Access Program**.

Access is formalized through a document titled:

> **Sigma Stratum Initiative — Open Standard Access Letter**

This letter:
- Grants non-exclusive R&D rights to use the Sigma Runtime specifications.  
- Permits development of internal tools, prototypes, and research extensions.  
- Requires publication of any architectural modifications as **SRIP** proposals.  
- Guarantees interoperability with the canonical specification.  
- Confirms non-transfer of IP ownership.

The letter is **not a contract** and **does not provide exclusivity**.  
It serves as a declaration of participation under the open-standard covenant.

---

## 3. How to Request an Access Letter

**Sigma Stratum Research Group (SSRG)**  
legal@sigmastratum.org  

Please include:
- Organization name and country  
- Contact person and title
